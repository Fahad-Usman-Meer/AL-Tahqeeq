    <h1>About Us</h1>

        Welcome to 
    <u><a href="http://www.altahqeeq.com ">AL-TAHQEEQ</a></u>, your number one source for all things Islamic Research. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of Islamic Research Material, with a focus on Quranic References & Authentic Ahadees.

        <br /><br />
        Founded in 2018 by me (FAHAD USMAN MEER), AL-TAHQEEQ has come a long way from its beginnings in Pakistan. When I (FAHAD USMAN MEER) first started out, my passion for "Research Islamic Content" drove me to do tons of research, so that AL-TAHQEEQ can offer you "the world's most authentic sources". I'm thrilled that i'm able to turn my passion into my own website.

        <br />
        I hope you enjoy my research as much as I enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to <u>@Html.ActionLink("Contact Me", "Contact", "Home")</u>.
